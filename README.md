# Giphy's Search Engine with Angular 9

This project is a gif search engine and is the final project of the Angular Module for [Toti Diversidade](https://totidiversidade.com.br/).  
I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript and Angular internal libraries.  
The template I used is from [Colorlib](https://colorlib.com/wp/) with some modifications :)  
Hope you like!  

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
